# Protocol Summary

PasswordStore is a protocol dedicated to storage and retrieval of a user's passwords. The protocol is designed to be used by a single user, and is not designed to be used by multiple users. Only the owner should be able to set and access this password.

# Disclaimer

I (Aayush Gupta) make every effort to identify as many vulnerabilities in the code within the given time period but bear no responsibility for the findings presented in this document. A security audit by the team does not constitute an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed, and the code review focused solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

### [H-1] Storing the password on-chain makes it visible to anyone and no longer private.

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PaswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through the `Password::getPassword` function, which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract.

we show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** (Proof of Code)

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain.

1. create a locally running chain
   ```bash
   make anvil
   ```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain
   ```
   make deploy
   ```

3. Run the storage tool
   We use `1` beacuse that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract

   ```
   cast storage <address here> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
   ```

   You'll get something like this 

   `0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

   You can then parse that hex to a string with:

   ```
   cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
   ```

   and get an output of:

   ```
   myPassword
   ```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember an additional off-chain password for decryption. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view functions, as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password.

----------------------


### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` has no access controls, meaning a non-owner could change the password

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function. However, the netspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>       // @audit - There is no access control 
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract, severly breaking the contract intended functionality.

**Proof Of Concept:** Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test file.

<Details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```Javascript
   function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
        vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomAddress);
        string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        string memory originalPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
        assertEq(expectedPassword, originalPassword);
    }
```

</Details>


**Recommended Mitigation:** Add Access control like

```Javascript
   function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>        if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
@>          revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
@>       }
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

## Medium

## Low 

## Informational

### [I-1] Incorrect Parameter in `PasswordStore::getPassword` Netspec

**Description:**
```javascript
   /*
     * @notice This function allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {}
```
The function signature for `PasswordStore::getPassword` is `getPassword()`, but the netspec incorrectly suggests it should be `getPassword(string)`.

**Impact:** 
This discrepancy in the netspec leads to confusion.

**Proof Of Concept:** 
None.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Correct the netspec by removing the inaccurate parameter description.

```diff
- * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
